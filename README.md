This repository holds an example widget as showcase for the Staffbase custom widget development. This example should help developers creating their own custom widget.

This widget can be used to display the weather at the current time or a fixed date in the future for an individual city. To show the weather the city (optional with country code) needs to be added in the widget configuration.
